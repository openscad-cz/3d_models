Miscellaneous 3d Models for 3d printer

All these models have been successfully printed on a Da Vinci 3D printer. I use OpenSCAD (http://www.openscad.org/) to build the models and Slic3r (http://slic3r.org/) to generate the g-code.

* coin_cell_holder is a nice little battery holder for a Teensy 3.x (https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy31.html) RTC battery. It mounts right on the Teensy, which is great for bread-boarding the Teensy while maintaining the RTC time. In a PCB mount, it saves valuable board space.
 
* solar2 is a simple board to mount a pair of solar cells. There is a recess behind the cells for the wiring and diode.

* solar_box has nothing to do with solar cells; it's a housing for my Teensy-based aquarium light controller. The light consists of strips of RGB LEDs that the controller adjusts via PWM and drives the LEDs through a Darlington array. It simulates sunrise and sunset (luminance and chroma) at preset times (thus the name 'solar'). Firmware is available: https://github.com/rfdougherty/gadgets/blob/master/SunSim/SunSim.ino. Hardware design available upon request (but it's basically just a Teensy3 with RTC crystal and battery, four PWM outputs connected to a Darlington array (https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/uln2803a.pdf), and a rotary encoder (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9117).

* skull_shaker is a left/right pair of housings for Piezo transducers that we use for the CNI bone-conduction auditory stimulus system.

* CNI_touch is a work-in-progress for a housing for the CNI touchpad response device.

There is miscellaneous other stuff in here too.
