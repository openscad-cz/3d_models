To convert freesurfer surfaces to stl:

mris_convert surf/lh.pial lh.stl

import lh and rh in meshlab
Merge mesh layers to unify the hemispheres (Filters->Mesh Layer->Flatten Visible Layers)
(or apply the following to each, then merge-- may work better)
Apply taublin smoothing (100 iterations)
Quadratic edge simplification (preserve topology and normals, percentage reduction: 0.05)
Scale to .333 is good. .5 should work. Should try full-size.

Building:
0.3mm layer height is best. Need support material, glue stick on bed.

per-hemisphere:
LH: rotate 90 deg in y-axis
